# üîí SkillCraft Technology Projects

This repository showcases four hands-on cybersecurity and Python programming projects, each demonstrating key concepts in information security and automation.

***

## Task 01: Caesar Cipher Text Encryption & Decryption

**Description:**  
Build a program to encrypt and decrypt messages using the classic Caesar Cipher algorithm. Users provide a message and a shift value to transform the text into an unreadable format and back.

**How to Run:**
1. Copy the provided Python code for Caesar Cipher.
2. Run the script in your terminal or IDE.
3. Input your message and shift value when prompted.
4. View the encrypted and decrypted output in your console.

***

## Task 02: Image Encryption Tool (Pixel Manipulation)

**Description:**  
Develop an image encryption tool using pixel manipulation. The tool uses the XOR bitwise operation with a numeric key to scramble and restore images.

**How to Run:**
1. Save the sample Python code using Pillow and NumPy.
2. Ensure your image (e.g., `Screenshot-9.jpg`) is in the script directory.
3. Update the script to use your image filename.
4. Run the script and follow prompts to produce encrypted and decrypted images.

## Task 03: Password Strength Assessment Tool

**Description:**  
Create a program to assess password strength based on length, uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

**How to Run:**
1. Copy and run the Python code for password strength assessment.
2. Enter a password when prompted.
3. Receive instant visual feedback on password rating and criteria compliance.

***

## Task 04: Keylogger (Keystroke Recording)

**Description:**  
Set up a basic keylogger that records keystrokes and logs them to a file for educational, parental, or authorized debugging use.

**How to Run:**
1. Ensure `pynput` is installed (`pip install pynput`).
2. Save and run the provided Python keylogger code.
3. Press keys to record; the program logs to `keystrokes.txt`.
4. Press ESC to stop logging and review the file.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Ethical Guidelines

- **For educational and authorized use only.**
- Always follow privacy laws and secure consent before monitoring.
- Never distribute or use these projects for unethical activities.

***

## üöÄ Getting Started

Clone this project, install required libraries (`pillow`, `numpy`, `pynput`), and explore each script to strengthen your programming and cybersecurity skills. Each task demonstrates practical code, real-world security concepts, and hands-on experience.
